# Clipman-Mac
User-friendly terminal-based clipboard manager for macOS

Why use this?
macOS lacks a native, terminal-friendly clipboard manager. This script fills that gap by providing a robust, lightweight, and easy-to-use solution that integrates perfectly with your terminal workflow.
Installation
Requires `fzf` and standard macOS clipboard utilities (`pbcopy`/`pbpaste`). Install dependencies with Homebrew:
#brew install fzf
